# Recipe App Frontend

## Yum Recipe App

Yum is a recipe app that allows users to discover and share delicious recipes. With Yum, you can explore a wide variety of recipes, save your favorite ones, and even contribute by adding your own recipes to the collection.

## Features

- Browse a collection of mouthwatering recipes
- Search for recipes by keywords, ingredients, or categories
- Save your favorite recipes for easy access
- Contribute your own recipes to share with the community
- Edit or delete your own recipes
- User-friendly interface 

## Technologies Used

- React: JavaScript library for building user interfaces
- React Router: Routing library for navigation within the app
- Ruby on Rails: Web application framework
- PostgreSQL: Relational database for storing recipe data
- HTML5 & CSS3: Markup and styling for the app
- Bootstrap: CSS framework for responsive design
- Render: Cloud platform for hosting and deploying the app

## What We Learned

Throughout the development of the Yum Recipe App, we gained valuable knowledge and experience in building a full-stack web application using React for the frontend and Ruby on Rails for the backend. Here are some key learnings from the project:

- React: We learned how to structure a React application, create reusable components, manage state and props, handle form submissions, and implement client-side routing using React Router.
- Ruby on Rails: We deepened our understanding of Ruby on Rails, including setting up a RESTful API backend, handling database migrations and relationships, implementing controllers and routes, and integrating third-party libraries and gems.
- API Communication: We learned how to communicate between the frontend and backend using API calls, handle data serialization and deserialization, and handle different types of requests and responses.
- Database Management: We gained experience in setting up and configuring a PostgreSQL database, creating and managing database models, and performing CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations.
- Authentication and Authorization: We implemented authentication and authorization using JWT (JSON Web Tokens) and Devise. We learned how to generate and validate tokens, protect routes from unauthorized access, and manage user authentication and authorization.
- Frontend Styling: We explored frontend styling techniques using CSS, Bootstrap, and Reactstrap to create a visually appealing and user-friendly interface.
- Testing: We familiarized ourselves with testing methodologies and tools, including writing unit tests and running test suites using frameworks like Jest and Rails testing tools.
- Collaboration: Working on this project allowed us to practice effective collaboration using version control systems like Git, managing project tasks and issues, and coordinating efforts to deliver a high-quality application.

## Challenges Faced and Future Features

During the development of the Yum Recipe App, we encountered several challenges that helped us grow as developers. Here are some of the challenges we faced:

- Authentication and Authorization: Implementing authentication and authorization using JWT tokens and Devise required careful consideration of security practices and ensuring proper handling of user sessions and access control.
- Styling: Ensuring consistent styling across the app and creating a seamless user experience presented challenges in terms of design and responsiveness.
- Deployment: Overcoming hurdles during the deployment process and ensuring compatibility between different environments.

### Future Features

Although the Yum Recipe App already offers a range of features, here are several features we hope to add in the future:

- User Profiles: Allow users to create profiles, personalize their settings, and view their saved recipes and submitted recipes.
- Social Sharing: Implement social media sharing functionality to enable users to share their favorite recipes with friends and followers.
- Advanced Search: Enhance the search functionality to include advanced filters, sorting options, and recipe recommendations based on user preferences.
- Rating and Reviews: Add a rating and review system to allow users to provide feedback and share their experiences with recipes.
- Meal Planning: Introduce meal planning features, including the ability to create meal plans, generate shopping lists, and schedule cooking activities.

We are excited about the future of the Yum Recipe App and look forward to continuously improving and expanding its features to provide an exceptional culinary experience for our users.

## Testing

Testing is an important part of ensuring the quality and reliability of the Yum Recipe App. We employed two main testing frameworks for different parts of the application:

- Jest: We used Jest, a JavaScript testing framework, to write and run tests for the frontend components and functionality. With Jest, we performed unit testing to verify the correct rendering of components, the functionality of links and images, and the proper handling of user input on the login and register pages.

- RSpec: We used RSpec, a testing tool for Ruby, to test the server-side functionality as well as the backend API. We created tests using RSpec to validate the API endpoints, check the functionality of the controllers and models, and guarantee that the data and replies were handled correctly.

Testing played a crucial role in identifying and preventing issues, ensuring the application behaves as expected, and allowing us to make confident changes and updates.

## Deployment

The Yum Recipe App is deployed on the Render cloud platform, providing reliable hosting and deployment capabilities.

## Credits

The Yum Recipe App would not have been possible without the contributions and support of the following individuals and resources:

- Sam Saenz, Lead Tech 
- Spencer Johnson, Head of UX/UI
- Eddie Carrion, Project Manager

## Acknowledgements

The Yum Recipe App would not have been possible without the contributions and support of the following libraries, frameworks, and resources:

- Bootstrap and Reactstrap: We utilized Bootstrap and Reactstrap for their CSS framework and pre-built components, enabling us to create a responsive and visually appealing user interface.

- W3Schools and Learn Academy Syllabus: These educational resources provided valuable documentation and tutorials that assisted us in learning web development concepts, including HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

- Jest: Jest is a JavaScript testing library that we used for writing and running unit tests for the frontend components and functionality. It played a crucial role in ensuring the correctness and reliability of our frontend code.

- Ruby on Rails and RSpec: We relied on the official Ruby on Rails website and the RSpec testing framework to guide us in building and testing the server-side functionality and the backend API.

## Biggest Wins and Losses

Throughout the development process, we experienced both wins and losses. Here are some of the notable highlights:

- Biggest Wins:
  - Successfully implementing authentication and authorization using JWT tokens and Devise.
  - Creating an intuitive and user-friendly interface that enhances the recipe browsing and contribution experience.
  - Deploying the application to the Render cloud platform for reliable hosting and deployment.

- Losses:
  - Facing challenges with consistent styling across the application and ensuring a seamless user experience.
  - Overcoming hurdles during the deployment process and resolving compatibility issues.

We learned valuable lessons from both our wins and losses, and they have shaped us as developers.
